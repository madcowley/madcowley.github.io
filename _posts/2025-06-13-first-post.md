# Hello!

I'm at a crossroads. For most of my life my identity was tied up with music and sound. I play drums, and flirted with success but we never really consummated. Music went off to flirt with other people, and I was left with tinnitus and a day job as a software developer.

Now I find myself in my (very) late fifties, and need to come alive. Part of this internal renaissance is to read more. I'm reading history, politics, and started a program of reading the Great Books. Also, quite a bit about AI and its implications for our future.

I've also been learning languages - I started with Spanish during the pandemic, and also started picking up some German and French.

I've started, essentially, trying to cultivate a life of the mind. Something I missed out on by going to a technical institute instead of a university (not realizing the difference), and veering into music.

This is a new blog, as an experiment. To write and to learn in public. To try and make sense of the world, especially the batshit crazy world we're in right now.
